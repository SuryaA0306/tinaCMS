Angular Material components depend on system variables defined as CSS variables through the material.theme Sass mixin. This page provides guidance and documentation for using these variables to customize components.

## Colors

Material Design uses color to create accessible, personal color schemes that communicate your product's hierarchy, state, and brand. See Material Design's [Color System](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/system/overview) page to learn more about its use and purpose.

The following colors are the most often used in Angular Material components. Use these colors and follow their uses to add theme colors to your application's custom components.

Primary--mat-sys-primary

The most common color used by Angular Material components to participate in the application theme.

Examples include the background color of filled buttons, the icon color of selected radio buttons, and the outline color of form fields.

Use the color --mat-sys-on-primary for icons, text, and other visual elements placed on a primary background. This color is calculated to be optimal for accessibility and legibility.

Surface--mat-sys-surface

A low-emphasis background color that provides a clear contrast for both light and dark themes and their varied theme colors.

Examples include the background color of the application and most components such as the dialog, card, table, and more.

Use the color --mat-sys-on-surface for icons, text, and other visual elements placed on a surface background. This color is calculated to be optimal for accessibility and legibility.

Error--mat-sys-error

High-contrast color meant to alert the user to attract immediate attention.

Examples include the background color of the badge and the text color of invalid form fields inputs.

Use the color --mat-sys-on-error for icons, text, and other visual elements placed on an error background. This color is calculated to be optimal for accessibility and legibility.

Outline--mat-sys-outline

Used for borders and dividers to help provide visual separation between and around elements.

Examples include the color of the divider and border color of an outlined form field.

Use the color --mat-sys-outline-variant for a less prominent outline.

## Typography

There are five categories of font types defined by Material Design: body, display, headline, label, and title. Each category has three sizes: small, medium, and large.

Learn more about how these categories and their sizes should be used in your application by visiting Material Design's [Typography](https://m3.material.io/styles/typography/overview) documentation.

Each system variable can be applied to the "font" CSS style. Additionally, the parts of the variable definition can be accessed individually by appending the keywords "font", "line-height", "size", "tracking", and "weight".

For example, the values for medium body text may be defined as follows:

\--mat-sys-body-medium: 400 0.875rem / 1.25rem Roboto, sans-serif;
\--mat-sys-body-medium-font: Roboto, sans-serif;
\--mat-sys-body-medium-line-height: 1.25rem;
\--mat-sys-body-medium-size: 0.875rem;
\--mat-sys-body-medium-tracking: 0.016rem;
\--mat-sys-body-medium-weight: 400;

## Elevation

Material Design provides six levels of elevation that can be used to provide a sense of depth and organization to an application's UI. Learn more at Material Design's [Elevation](https://m3.material.io/styles/elevation/overview) guide.

These levels are defined as CSS box-shadow values that can be styled to an element.

box-shadow: var(--mat-sys-level0)box-shadow: var(--mat-sys-level1)box-shadow: var(--mat-sys-level2)box-shadow: var(--mat-sys-level3)box-shadow: var(--mat-sys-level4)box-shadow: var(--mat-sys-level5)

## Overrides

The mat.theme-overrides mixin can be included to emit different definitions for the system variables and override the definitions emitted from mat.theme.

This example container has several system variables overridden by including the following Sass code:  @include mat.theme-overrides((
    primary: #ebdcff,
    on-primary: #230f46,
    body-medium: 500 1.15rem/1.3rem Arial,
    corner-large: 32px,
    level3: 0 4px 6px 1px var(--mat-sys-surface-dim),
  ));
